## Notes

Learning XCode was a bit confusing at first because elements were not easily moving and then at times the UI would not be shown when running only a black screen was shown. Moving forward from the simple app we were supposed to build adding my own features to it was at first hard because I was still learning, but from a trial and error process I was able to move forward and finish the app. For example, I did not know how to create a background over certain elements, so I had to experiment and search online to figure how to do it and accomplish the task at hand.
