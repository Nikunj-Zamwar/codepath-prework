EzTip is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Nikunj Zamwar

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Added some background colors to make it easier for the user and some font size changes were made to make it easier on the eyes
- [ ] Added a tip slider rather than 3 options to give a range of options
- [ ] Added an additional calculator for total calculations for parties

## Notes

Learning XCode was a bit confusing at first because elements were not easily moving and then at times the UI would not be shown when running only a black screen was shown. Moving forward from the simple app we were supposed to build adding my own features to it was at first hard because I was still learning, but from a trial and error process I was able to move forward and finish the app. For example, I did not know how to create a background over certain elements, so I had to experiment and search online to figure how to do it and accomplish the task at hand.
